# Assumptions
Built on the principle of a modular monolith, as building microservices would take extensive time.
There is more that could be done architecturally, further division of the dtos, models, and entities 
such that there is less coupling between the modules would be better.

# Consideration

Be sure to set the spring profile, supported profiles are dev and prod.
